###                                   Abstract
						
The first step to good agricultural yield is protecting the plants from diseases. Early plant disease recognition and prevention is the first step in this regard. But manual disease recognition is time-consuming and costly. This is one of those use cases, where deep learning can be used proactively for great benefit. Using deep learning, we can recognize plant diseases very effectively. Large scale plant disease recognition using deep learning can cut costs to a good extent.


The goal of this project is to develop algorithms that can accurately diagnose a disease based on an image.We will use deep learning for disease recognition on the PlantVillage dataset using deep learning and PyTorch.
