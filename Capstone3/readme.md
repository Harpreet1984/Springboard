###                                   Abstract
						
The first step to good agricultural yield is protecting the plants from diseases. Early plant disease recognition and prevention is the first step in this regard. But manual disease recognition is time-consuming and costly. This is one of those use cases, where deep learning can be used proactively for great benefit. Using deep learning, we can recognize plant diseases very effectively. Large scale plant disease recognition using deep learning can cut costs to a good extent.


The goal of this project is to develop algorithms that can accurately diagnose a disease based on an image.We will use deep learning for disease recognition on the PlantVillage dataset using deep learning and PyTorch.

## 1. Introduction

Plant diseases, a deterioration in the original condition of the plant that upsets and changes its vital functions, are common problems that farmers and agronomists face from season to season. Various aspects can cause plant diseases, such as environmental conditions, the presence of pathogens, and the variety of crops located nearby the plant. In the initial period of most of the diseases, symptoms can be observed by looking at alterations of the physical properties of plants, such as alteration in color, size, and shape, due to the disease.

Plant diseases significantly disturb the progress of the plant and are recognized as one of the factors which affects food security. Consequently, fast, and accurate identification is essential to contain the spread of disease. However, the identification procedure is hampered by the complexity of the procedure. It is found that experienced agronomists and plant biologists find difficulty in differentiating certain plant diseases because of the multitude of symptoms that occur. The, where misdiagnosis leads to inadequate or inadequate treatment . An automation system at this level will support and reduce the workload of farmers and agronomists .

Over the last few years, the exponential growth in computing power, particularly in the graphics processing unit (GPU), has resulted in machine learning algorithms being able to run efficiently on servers due to their ability to compute processes in parallel. Additionally, the introduction of GPU platforms such as Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) from Nvidia has introduced a new platform for developers to accelerate applications which are compute intensive. This is accomplished by utilising the computing power of GPU in a way that is optimised for computation of complex algorithms such as gradient descent and back-propagation and gradient descent . Advances and breakthroughs in technology have enabled deep learning approaches to be widely used in many applications in nearly every field .

The deep learning model is created and based on combination of neural network architectures. In contrast to the conventional neural network architecture, which comprises of a few hidden layers only, a deep learning model may contain hundreds of hidden layers. This is one of the reasons which make deep learning, generally, can have higher accuracy in comparison with conventional methods. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) , which is characterized by its function for feature extraction in image recognition and image classification , is considered as one of the deep learning models. With different types of design, CNN model can conduct diverse types of operations on images.

The main contribution of the current study is the development of a deep learning model in the PyTorch environment which can identify plant diseases of various plant species based on plant leaf images on the edge.

### 1.1 Fundamentals <a name="subparagraph1"></a>
Plant diseases are generally classified into the following 3 categories: -
1) Viral- Viruses are very small infectious RNA parasite that often damages or kills the plantâ€™s infected cells. 
2) Bacterial- Bacteria is a member of group of microscopic single celled organisms which can only be seen through a microscope. Bacteria often overwhelm the immune system and results in severe and harmful diseases in living organisms.
 3) Fungal- Fungi are organisms that lack chlorophyll and thus they do not have the ability to photosynthesize their own food.Fungi are especially harmful during preharvest and postharvest of crops. They produce highly toxic, hallucinogenic chemicals that have affected millions of animals including humans and still continue to do so.
